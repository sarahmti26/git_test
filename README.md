# git_test
Hello GitHub!
This is my first gitHub repo and I am learning from "The Odin Project".

Hi Odin!

As I start my software/web developer career I will be uploading projects to my gitHub to extend my portofolio. 

For now I would like to add one project I have already done which is building my own weather app. Basic, but efficient to get through the basics !
